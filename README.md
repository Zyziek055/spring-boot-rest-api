## **Overview**

A RESTful backend API for an online store, built using Spring Boot. This project features a structured multi-layer architecture with support for key functionalities such as product management, shopping cart operations, messaging, and error handling. It uses standard REST principles and is designed to be easily extendable.
The application demonstrates how to design and build a production-style API using Java and Spring Boot. It includes controller layers for handling HTTP requests, service layers for business logic, and repositories for data persistence. A SQL script is also provided to initialize the database.
While developing this project, I learned how to:
- Structure a Spring Boot application following best practices
- Implement RESTful endpoints with proper exception handling
- Build and document custom controllers for domain-specific logic
- Connect the backend to a relational database using Spring Data JPA
- Use DTOs and mapping techniques to manage data transfer and encapsulation
